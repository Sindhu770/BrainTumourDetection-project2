This project focuses on building a deep learning-based brain tumor classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python with libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and others. The main goal is to classify MRI brain scan images into two categories: tumor and non-tumor. The system begins with loading and preprocessing the dataset, which consists of brain MRI images. Each image is resized and normalized to ensure consistency in input shape and pixel value distribution. Augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, and shifting are applied to increase data diversity and improve model generalization. A custom CNN architecture is then built from scratch, comprising convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for final classification. The model is compiled using binary cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer for efficient training. Throughout training, performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are tracked and visualized to assess learning progression. The trained model is then evaluated on a separate validation/test set to measure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Additional testing is performed on new MRI images to validate the classifierâ€™s prediction capabilities, with results displayed using OpenCV and Matplotlib. This system offers a non-invasive and efficient tool to assist medical professionals in the early detection of brain tumors, potentially accelerating diagnosis and treatment planning. Although trained on a limited dataset, the architecture is scalable and can be fine-tuned or retrained using more diverse data or advanced pre-trained models for improved accuracy. This project exemplifies how machine learning and medical imaging can be combined to address critical challenges in healthcare using open-source tools.
